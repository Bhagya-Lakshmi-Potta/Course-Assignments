# Principal Component Analysis
Here The repositery contains how Eigen faces are generated from Face Images

Here Each face image is flattened to a vector and then formed the design matrix X 
Covariance matrix is Caluculates
Eigen Vectors Corresponding to highest eigen values are reshaped annd plotted
Thus we can see The eigen vectors holding lot of information about original data i.e face features
Then Take a random image and reconstructed it using Eigen Vectors or Eigen faces 

Linear Discriminant analysis

Linear discrminant analysis uses fisher diacriminant to project data 
Here Projection is on single dimension Since rank is 1
Then Each data point is plotted along with Class discription![Eigen_FAces]
